[NbConvertApp] Converting notebook 800_test_step_pumping.ipynb to notebook
/rds/general/user/sk1021/home/anaconda3/envs/simulation/lib/python3.12/site-packages/nbformat/__init__.py:93: MissingIDFieldWarning: Code cell is missing an id field, this will become a hard error in future nbformat versions. You may want to use `normalize()` on your notebooks before validations (available since nbformat 5.1.4). Previous versions of nbformat are fixing this issue transparently, and will stop doing so in the future.
